:::caution Currently in pre-alpha
Webdriver support for Tauri is still in pre-alpha. Tooling that is dedicated to it, such as [tauri-driver][], is still in active development and may change as necessary over time. Additionally, only Windows and Linux are currently supported.
:::

[WebDriver][] is a standardized interface to interact with web documents primarily intended for automated testing. Tauri supports the [WebDriver][] interface by leveraging the native platform's [WebDriver][] server underneath a cross-platform wrapper [`tauri-driver`][].

## Dipendenze di sistema

Install the latest [`tauri-driver`][] or update an existing installation by running:

```shell
cargo install tauri-driver
```

Because we currently utilize the platform's native [WebDriver][] server, there are some requirements for running [`tauri-driver`][] on supported platforms. Platform support is currently limited to Linux and Windows.

### Linux

We use `WebKitWebDriver` on Linux platforms. Check if this binary exists already (command `which WebKitWebDriver`) as some distributions bundle it with the regular WebKit package. Other platforms may have a separate package for them, such as `webkit2gtk-driver` on Debian-based distributions.

### Windows

Make sure to grab the version of [Microsoft Edge Driver][] that matches your Windows Edge version that the application is being built and tested on. This should almost always be the latest stable version on up-to-date Windows installs. If the two versions do not match, you may experience your WebDriver testing suite hanging while trying to connect.

The download contains a binary called `msedgedriver.exe`. [`tauri-driver`][] looks for that binary in the `$PATH` so make sure it's either available on the path or use the `--native-driver` option on [`tauri-driver`][]. You may want to download this automatically as part of the CI setup process to ensure the Edge, and Edge Driver versions stay in sync on Windows CI machines. A guide on how to do this may be added at a later date.

## Applicazione di esempio

The [next section](example/setup) of the guide shows step-by-step how to create a minimal example application that is tested with WebDriver.

If you prefer to see the result of the guide and look over a finished minimal codebase that utilizes it, you can look at https://github.com/chippers/hello_tauri. That example also comes with a CI script to test with GitHub actions, but you may still be interested in the [WebDriver CI](ci) guide as it explains the concept a bit more.
