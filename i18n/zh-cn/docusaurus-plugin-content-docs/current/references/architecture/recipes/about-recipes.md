Tauri recipes are descriptions of use cases that are entirely configurable within the `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file. 这些并不是 Tauri 所能完成的全部事情，还有更多更多用例待您探索。 If you discover one, please get in touch and help us update this collection!

If you haven't read about the general design of Tauri, then it would make the most sense for you to visit the [Quick Start][] guide and become familiar with the basic architecture and terminology used in these recipes.
