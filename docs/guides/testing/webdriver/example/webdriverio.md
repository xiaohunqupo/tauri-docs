# WebdriverIO

:::info Example Application
This [WebdriverIO] guide expects you to have already gone through the [example Application setup] to follow
step-by-step. The general information may still be helpful otherwise.
:::

This WebDriver testing example will use [WebdriverIO], and its testing suite. It is expected to have Node.js already
installed, along with `npm` or `yarn` although the [finished example project] uses `yarn`.

## Create a Directory for the Tests

Let's create a space to write these tests in our project. We will be using a nested directory for
this example project as we will later also go over other frameworks, but typically you only need to use one. Create
the directory we will use with `mkdir -p webdriver/webdriverio`. The rest of this guide assumes you are inside the
`webdriver/webdriverio` directory.

## Initializing a WebdriverIO Project

We will be using a pre-existing `package.json` to bootstrap this test suite because we have already chosen specific
[WebdriverIO] config options and want to showcase a simple working solution. The bottom of this section has a collapsed
guide on setting it up from scratch.

`package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "webdriverio",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "test": "wdio run wdio.conf.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@wdio/cli": "^7.9.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@wdio/local-runner": "^7.9.1",
    "@wdio/mocha-framework": "^7.9.1",
    "@wdio/spec-reporter": "^7.9.0"
  }
}
```

We have a script that runs a [WebdriverIO] config as a test suite exposed as the `test` command. We also have various
dependencies added by the `@wdio/cli` command when we first set it up. In short, these dependencies are for
the most simple setup using a local WebDriver runner, [Mocha] as the test framework, and a simple Spec Reporter.

The CLI is interactive, and you may choose the tools to work with yourself. Note that you will likely diverge from
the rest of the guide, and you need to set up the differences yourself.

Let's add the [WebdriverIO] CLI to this npm project.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager"
defaultValue="yarn"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'}, {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'}, {label: 'Bun', value: 'bun'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install @wdio/cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @wdio/cli
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Bun">

```shell
bun add @wdio/cli
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To then run the interactive config command to set up a [WebdriverIO] test suite, you can then run:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager"
defaultValue="yarn"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'}, {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'}, {label: 'Bun', value: 'bun'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npx wdio config
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn wdio config
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Bun">

```shell
bunx wdio config
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</details>

## Config

You may have noticed that the `test` script in our `package.json` mentions a file `wdio.conf.js`. That's the [WebdriverIO]
config file which controls most aspects of our testing suite.

`wdio.conf.js`:

```js
const os = require('os')
const path = require('path')
const { spawn, spawnSync } = require('child_process')

// keep track of the `tauri-driver` child process
let tauriDriver

exports.config = {
  specs: ['./test/specs/**/*.js'],
  maxInstances: 1,
  capabilities: [
    {
      maxInstances: 1,
      'tauri:options': {
        application: '../../target/release/hello-tauri-webdriver',
      },
    },
  ],
  reporters: ['spec'],
  framework: 'mocha',
  mochaOpts: {
    ui: 'bdd',
    timeout: 60000,
  },

  // ensure the rust project is built since we expect this binary to exist for the webdriver sessions
  onPrepare: () => spawnSync('cargo', ['build', '--release']),

  // ensure we are running `tauri-driver` before the session starts so that we can proxy the webdriver requests
  beforeSession: () =>
    (tauriDriver = spawn(
      path.resolve(os.homedir(), '.cargo', 'bin', 'tauri-driver'),
      [],
      { stdio: [null, process.stdout, process.stderr] }
    )),

  // clean up the `tauri-driver` process we spawned at the start of the session
  afterSession: () => tauriDriver.kill(),
}
```

If you are interested in the properties on the `exports.config` object, I [suggest reading the documentation][webdriver documentation].
For non-WDIO specific items, there are comments explaining why we are running commands in `onPrepare`, `beforeSession`,
and `afterSession`. We also have our specs set to `"./test/specs/**/*.js"`, so let's create a spec now.

## Spec

A spec contains the code that is testing your actual application. The test runner will load these specs and automatically
run them as it sees fit. Let's create our spec now in the directory we specified.

`test/specs/example.e2e.js`:

```js
// calculates the luma from a hex color `#abcdef`
function luma(hex) {
  if (hex.startsWith('#')) {
    hex = hex.substring(1)
  }

  const rgb = parseInt(hex, 16)
  const r = (rgb >> 16) & 0xff
  const g = (rgb >> 8) & 0xff
  const b = (rgb >> 0) & 0xff
  return 0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b
}

describe('Hello Tauri', () => {
  it('should be cordial', async () => {
    const header = await $('body > h1')
    const text = await header.getText()
    expect(text).toMatch(/^[hH]ello/)
  })

  it('should be excited', async () => {
    const header = await $('body > h1')
    const text = await header.getText()
    expect(text).toMatch(/!$/)
  })

  it('should be easy on the eyes', async () => {
    const body = await $('body')
    const backgroundColor = await body.getCSSProperty('background-color')
    expect(luma(backgroundColor.parsed.hex)).toBeLessThan(100)
  })
})
```

The `luma` function on top is just a helper function for one of our tests and is not related to the actual testing of
the application. If you are familiar with other testing frameworks, you may notice similar functions being exposed that
are used, such as `describe`, `it`, and `expect`. The other APIs, such as items like `$` and its exposed methods, are
covered by the [WebdriverIO API docs].

## Running the Test Suite

Now that we are all set up with config and a spec let's run it!

<Tabs groupId="package-manager"
defaultValue="yarn"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'}, {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'}, {label: 'Bun', value: 'bun'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm test
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn test
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Bun">

```shell
bun run test
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We should see output the following output:

```text
➜  webdriverio git:(main) ✗ yarn test
yarn run v1.22.11
$ wdio run wdio.conf.js

```

We see the Spec Reporter tell us that all 3 tests from the `test/specs/example.e2e.js` file, along with the final report
`Spec Files: 1 passed, 1 total (100% completed) in 00:00:01`.

Using the [WebdriverIO] test suite, we just easily enabled e2e testing for our Tauri application from just a few lines
of configuration and a single command to run it! Even better, we didn't have to modify the application at all.
