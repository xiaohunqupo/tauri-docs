Before we continue, make sure you have completed the [prerequisites] to have a working development environment.

Tauri is a framework to build desktop applications with any frontend framework and a Rust core. Each app consists of two parts:

1. Rust binary that creates the windows and exposes native functionality to those windows
2. Frontend of your choice that produces the user interface inside the window

In the following, we will first scaffold the frontend, set up the Rust project, and lastly show you how to communicate between the two.
